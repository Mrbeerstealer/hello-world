# hello-world
Introduction to Github.
An introduction about myself should start with my favourite activity: Drinking beer with friends and having a good time.
This good time can be enhanced and/or individually recreated by such things as: board games, computer games, drinking games(prepare for a hangover), movie watching, pub quizes and cooking.
Though these are only a few things in my life, they are probably what I enjoy the most.
Most times I will also be interested in whatever anyone might propose. This does not mean that I am a (complete) pushover, since I will tell you when I don't want to do something. I am simply interested in new things and will experience most of them to form an opinion.
Sadly I do not consider myself a creative person. Even though I would love to be able to draw anything, to create a piece of music or just about any form of art seems to be beyond me. The commitment necesarry is something I sorely lack.
Music, drawings of all sorts and art in general do however influence my life. Whenever I can I will listen to music and I purposfully search for artists that I would like to follow in life.
Finally I think I should share some things about me that some might think were odd. I do not like animals. Now this is not to say that I hate them either, but I do not look at a dog or a cat and think about getting one myself. Birds, ferrets, goldfish or any other animal gets the same treatment. I am happy that we have animals since test tube meat is still far off. And even then we should not throw away what was cultivated by our ancestors for thousands of years. A lot of innovation can be found in the past. 
I also don't enjoy eating banana's, crab and most fish. But this is true hatred since they induce vomiting within me.
